<h1>About Me</h1>
<br></br>
<p>As a Junior Software Developer with a background in tech sales, I bring a unique blend of problem-solving, communication, and technical skills to every project. Having recently completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp at General Assembly, I specialize in front-end development with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. 
    </p>
<br />
    <p>
My journey into development wasn't about leaving sales behind—it was about becoming a sharper, more credible partner to the technical buyers I work with. I’m passionate about startups, SaaS, and crafting compelling, customer-first solutions. Now, I'm focused on growing within high-performing sales teams, especially those selling innovative, API-first products.

<h1>About Me</h1>
<br></br>
<p>I'm a former SaaS Sales Executive who developed a deeper technical foundation through a Software Engineering Bootcamp at General Assembly. I thrive at the intersection of tech and commercial strategy—whether that's opening pipeline, running discovery with technical stakeholders, or understanding how APIs and platforms create value.</p>
<br />
    <p>
    My career shift was motivated by a desire to transition into a more technical role within the tech industry I’ve always admired. I’m passionate about crafting user-friendly, innovative solutions and thrive in environments that challenge my creativity and technical skills. Looking ahead, I aim to continue growing as a developer, with aspirations to build user-focused, scalable applications, in a SaaS company.</p>
