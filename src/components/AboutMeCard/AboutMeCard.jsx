<h1>About Me</h1>
<br></br>
<p>As a Junior Software Developer with a background in tech sales, I bring a unique blend of problem-solving, communication, and technical skills to every project. Having recently completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp at General Assembly, I specialize in front-end development with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. 
    </p>
<br />
    <p>
    My career shift was motivated by a desire to transition into a more technical role within the tech industry I’ve always admired. I’m passionate about crafting user-friendly, innovative solutions and thrive in environments that challenge my creativity and technical skills. Looking ahead, I aim to continue growing as a developer, with aspirations to combine my development expertise with my sales background in a future sales engineering role.</p>
